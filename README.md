# Free5e format tests
This repository contains a number of possible formats for writing the books for [Free5e](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmworkspublishing/free5e-a-free-open-source-dungeons-and-dragons-alternative) in.
Specifically, these test files take their text from the *Free5e Players' Guide*.

The text used is work in progress and does not represent the full current state of the text.
