### Creating a Character

As a player, begin by creating a character on the character sheet in the back of this book or a color-coded one at [LINK]. If you’re using a paper copy, we recommend writing in an erasable medium like pencil.

1. Think of a fantasy character concept that you’d like to play
2. Determine ability scores
3. Choose your class
4. Choose your ancestry
5. Choose your heritage
6. Choose your background
7. Choose your starting equipment
8. Choose starting spells if applicable
9. Add details like appearance, personality, etc. Consider drawing a picture of your character. It doesn’t have to be fancy! It’s just for your friends! (If you’d like to commission a professional portrait of your character, check the credits of this book for some great artists who love illustrating characters!)

#### Determine Ability Scores
Use the following scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Assign each of these numbers to one of your character’s six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability. 

#### Variant: Ability Score Point Buy
You have 27 points to spend on ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. Then add 3 points to the character’s abilities, no more than two to any single ability.

**Ability Score Point Cost**

| Score | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

#### Ability Modifiers
Your final ability scores determine your modifiers. Find your modifier by subtracting 10 from the ability score and dividing by 2 (round down).
