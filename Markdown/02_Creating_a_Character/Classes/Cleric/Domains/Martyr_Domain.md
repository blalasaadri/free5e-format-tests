#### Matyr Domain

Followers of gods that believe in taking on the suffering of those around them.
Stalwart and unflinching, these intrepid souls seek to ease the suffering of those around them.
While typically altruistic, sometimes their motivations are further afield, belonging to strange cults of suffering or acceptance.

##### Domain Spells
You gain domain spells at the Cleric levels listed on the [Martyr Domain Spells table](#cleric-domain-martry-spells-table).
Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the Cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Cleric spell for you.

**Martyr Domain Domain Spells (table)**

##### Clad in Grace
Starting at 1st level, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

##### Relieve Suffering
Starting at 1st level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points, you can expend some of your own hit points to increase the amount another creature that is healed by the spell regains, expending a number of hit points up to your Cleric level to increase the amount one creature is healed by an equivalent value.

Additionally, you can touch a creature suffering a disease or the blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned condition and transfer that disease or condition to yourself.
Starting at 9th level, the range of conditions you can take increases, including exhaustion (1 level at a time), petrified, stunned, the effect of a curse, or any reduction to their ability scores.
You are afflicted by the effect in the same manner the creature you took it was, for the same duration and possible methods of ending the effect.

You can transfer a condition affecting another creature to yourself a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses on a long rest.

##### Channel Divinity: Bear the Burden

As an action, you present your holy symbol and enter a divine trance.
Until the start of your next turn, your movement speed becomes zero and you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Cleric level.
Any time an allied creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, they have resistance to the damage taken, but you take damage equal to the damage they take.

##### Overcome Adversity
Starting at 6th level, when you use your [Relieve Suffering](#relieve-suffering) to take the condition affecting a creature, you can repeat the original saving throw against the feature if it had one.
On success, the condition ends instead of being transferred.

Additionally, when you take damage as a result of the Warding Bond spell, you have resistance to that damage.
