Common coins are made of gold, silver, and copper, with different denominations based on their metal worth.

A gold piece can buy a bedroll, rope, or a goat. Skilled artisans earn one gold piece daily.
Gold is the standard unit of wealth, though coins aren’t commonly used.
When discussing deals worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, transactions usually involve gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

A gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, which buy a laborer’s work, lamp oil, or a poor inn’s night’s rest.
A silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which buy candles, torches, or chalk.

Unusual coins made of other precious metals, like electrum and platinum, sometimes appear in treasure hoards.
Electrum is worth five silver pieces, and platinum is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.
